cstr is a header-only C99 library for strings. The strings of this library do not touch the stack at all.
I primarily created this library because of safety issues with the usual raw strings in C.

For more information, see the webpage:

The library is offered under the Unlicense license. You are free to do whatever you like with it and don't
even have to give me credits (Although appreciated). See COPYING for more.
